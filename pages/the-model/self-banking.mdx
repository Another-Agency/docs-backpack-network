# Overview

Self banking is the idea that you can do everything that a bank does for you, yourself. This includes: creating and deleting accounts, transferring money between accounts, view account balances, and move money around through connected networks. 
The banks have their downsides but they have fully enabled modern society to function, if it were simple to replace them this would conceivably have been done long ago. We have a regular and consistent type of utility from banks and we therefore demand that as table stakes when using anything crypto based.


## Self Custody

Self custody is the idea that you can hold your own money and not have to trust a third party to do it for you. This is a core principle of crypto and is the reason why it is so powerful. It is also the reason why it is so hard to use.
