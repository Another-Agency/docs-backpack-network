# Accounts Overview

Backpack revolutionizes personal banking by embedding a bank's functionality into blockchain-based accounts. These accounts serve as the primary touchpoint for users, safeguarding assets and simplifying transactions.

## Persona: Your Digital Financial Identity
The Persona aspect of Backpack is more than just an account — it's your entire financial identity encapsulated within our platform. It's designed to resonate with every aspect of your financial journey:

- **Records**: Not merely transaction logs, but enriched narratives that give context to your financial actions.
- **Assets**: Managed with the utmost clarity, ensuring your financial assets are always presented simply and accessibly.

Personas reflect the complexity of our financial behavior, adapting to whether you're investing, spending, or saving.

## Contracts: Smart Financial Management
Backpack's contracts do more than execute code; they are the smart underpinnings that automate and secure financial operations:

- **Custom Security Models**: Tailored security settings to fit your personal comfort level and risk profile.
- **Gas Fee Management**: Our system smartly handles transaction fees so you can focus on your finances, not fees.
