# Accounts Overview

Backpack integrates the functionality of a bank into the very fabric of an account, powered by blockchain's transparent ledger system. Our accounts are the primary interface for users to interact with this ledger, holding assets securely and facilitating transactions with ease.

## Persona: The User Identity Foundation
Persona in Backpack serves as the cornerstone of user identity within our ecosystem, anchoring the user experience in trust and transactional fluidity. Here's a snapshot of what this entails:
