# Accounts

- smart contracts define the assets, security, and logic of the account
- keys are used to demonstrate ownership of the account the shape of the key determines how strong the security can be
- signatures are used to demonstrate intent of the account the shape of the signature determines how strong the security can be
- extensibility enables you to do more with the value and data your account holds

# Cards

- we currently offer a US based credit card that can spend your USDC as USD anywhere Visa is accepted
- card networks have two types of cards: credit and debit which each have their own benefits and drawbacks
- our card is based on the credit networks but functionally it works like a debit card
- add USDC using the 'Lock' feature and spend it anywhere Visa is accepted
- you can only spend locked USDC, if you don't spend it you can unlock it at any time
- locked token that's been spent will be formally redeemed on a monthly cycle begin from time of lock

# Gateways

- Pylon is our gateway service
- gateways are the generic term for financial transactions that move value between accounts
- gateways can be 1 of 3 types: on-ramp, off-ramp, in-network
- banking synonyms for gateways are: deposit, withdrawal, transfer
- we've chosen new terms because smart contracts enable chaining of events, you can't chain an ACH deposit for example dramatically enhancing possibilities making the previous definitions obsolete 

# Network Partners

- a network of money is functionally because of a coalition of partners that all value the same utility
- network partners are the ones that provide the services that give the network marketplace potential and value
- networks can have operating partners and referring partners
- our networks operate on a revenue sharing model that rewards partners for their contribution to the network
    1. operating partners are the ones that provide the services that give the network marketplace potential and value
    2. referring partners are the ones that bring new operators to the network
    - they are both critical to the mission and they are rewarded according to their types of contributions
