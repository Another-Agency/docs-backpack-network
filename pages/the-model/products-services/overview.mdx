# Introduction to Backpack Products and Services

Welcome to Backpack, where we redefine financial interaction through our core domain objects: Accounts, Gateways, and Network Partners. Each domain plays a pivotal role in creating a seamless, secure, and empowering financial ecosystem.

## Accounts: Your Financial Identity and Tools
Accounts are at the heart of Backpack, designed to encapsulate your financial persona and the instruments you use to interact with your assets:

- **Persona**: This represents your personal data and credentials, forming your unique financial identity within Backpack.
- **Smart Contracts**: These are the brains of your account, defining assets, security protocols, and operational logic with precision and flexibility.
- **Keys**: Acting as proof of ownership, keys are shaped to provide robust security, ensuring that only you can access your funds.
- **Signatures**: Demonstrating your intent, signatures are crafted to bolster the security of your transactions.
- **Plugins**: Offering the ability to extend and enhance your financial capabilities, plugins let you unlock the full potential of your money.

## Gateways: Your Access Points to Financial Movement
Gateways serve as conduits for value transfer, enabling a fluid exchange of assets across the Backpack network:

- **Pylon**: Introducing Pylon, our dedicated gateway service at the forefront of financial transactions.
- **Transaction Types**: We differentiate gateways into three categories: on-ramp, off-ramp, and in-network, each tailored to specific transactional needs.
- **Modern Terminology**: With smart contracts, traditional banking terms fall short. Our new lexicon reflects the advanced capabilities that smart contracts bring, allowing for complex transaction chains previously impossible.

## Network Partners: The Collaborative Force
Our network thrives on the synergy between partners who share a common goal of maximizing the utility of money:

- **Utility and Value Providers**: Our partners are selected for their ability to contribute meaningful services that enhance the network's marketplace viability.
- **Operational and Referral Dynamics**: We engage both operating partners, who fuel the network's service offerings, and referring partners, who introduce new capabilities and participants.
- **Revenue Sharing Model**: At Backpack, contribution is rewarded. Our revenue-sharing model incentivizes partners based on the value and growth they bring to the ecosystem.

Backpack is more than a platform; it's a collective vision where accounts, gateways, and network partners converge to forge a path towards a financially self-empowered future.
