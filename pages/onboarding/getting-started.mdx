2. KYC (Know Your Customer)

Unique to Backpack, once you complete KYC, you retain ownership of your KYC records, putting you in control of your data. This approach is a step towards reducing KYC-related costs and events in the financial ecosystem.

- Selfie: Upload a recent selfie for identity verification.

3. Fund Your Account
