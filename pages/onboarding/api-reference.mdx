The Pylon API is a RESTful API that allows you to access the Pylon platform programmatically. The API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
