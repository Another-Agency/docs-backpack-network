# Dear Community
 
There’s been a fundamental shift in how we manage our finances.

Once upon a time, financial control was inherently personal – a matter of private ledgers and individual stewardship. 
Then came the era of traditional banking, and with it, a relinquishing of control. Our financial privacy and autonomy 
were no longer solely ours but shared with institutions whose priorities often diverged from our own.

Today, we stand at the brink of a new era – one that echoes the past but is firmly rooted in the future. It’s time 
to reclaim what was always ours: the autonomy over our financial destinies.

Introducing Backpack, a groundbreaking approach to banking that puts you, the user, at the heart of every 
transaction, every decision.

Own Your Financial Identity: Why rent your financial identity from banks when you can own it outright? With Backpack, 
your account is yours – entirely. No third-party control, no hidden agendas. Just pure, unadulterated financial autonomy.

State-of-the-Art Security, Your Way: We believe security shouldn’t be a trade-off for privacy. Our platform leverages 
cutting-edge technology to ensure your assets are protected, while also granting you complete control over your 
personal data.

Simplicity Meets Sophistication: In an age where complexity is often mistaken for sophistication, we choose a different 
path. Our platform is designed for ease, ensuring the shortest path to your financial goals without compromising on 
capabilities.

Your Privacy, Your Rules: In a world where data is the new gold, we put the power back in your hands. Our self-custody 
solution ensures that your financial data stays exactly where it should – with you.

This is just the beginning. Join us as we chart a course towards a future where financial freedom isn’t just a dream, 
but a daily reality. Stay tuned for more updates.
