## Chatter 
Devin and James have taken this to revenue
- But now they need help to scale+handle existential threats
- Lots of ways we can solve this “self-banking” project, but to make process, we need to confirm to compliance depts (for tradfi interface

## Project List
Was created early this year, has an exhaustive list of what we need to accomplish

**Order is based on compliance**
- Compliance is all a semantic debate - we need to make it AS EASY AS POSSIBLE for them to check the boxes they need to leave us alone and move us through diligence
    - Solve their question before they ask them

### Backpack Website
- Mainly for compliance issues - we lost checkout.com because they couldn’t access our website

### Backpack Lite (aka Guest Account)
- We have a lot of this for compliance in written documents, but this isnt actually happening behind the scenes
- i.e. on a website, if you don’t have an account, you can checkout as a guest
    - You still fill out info including card, but the info isn’t saved
- But when WE do it, they need to buy USDC (kind of like an ATM)
    - But we need to replicate the guest account workflow because compliance needs it
- So backpack lite is the MOST EFFICIENT UX EXPERIENCE to replicate a guest account
    - So if we need an account - it needs to be custodied by the user (not us)
- OOTW, Reup, Sinful b beverages are all missing his functionality

### Backpack v1 - Timothy Leary
- Ebuka has been able to recreate and rebuild this
- This is the existing site/app that exists in app stores
- Compliance concerns - they are looking to have an onramp built into this app
    - They had a previous provider, but they pulled out so it’s has a bunch of basic functionality missing
    - So apple has removed the app

### Pylon v2 - Asgard
- Is the name of the gateway product
- The current version running is shit - but it still works great (customers are running)
- V2 is a redesign, building a better system
    - We get better operational efficiency (so cheaper to run and maintain), double code for every release
- Has a previous dev building this, but have to fork repo for every client
    - Each fork has client-specific changes as well
    - So there are a TON of GitHub repo
- So will still use the old version for now, but will try to update this as we go
- Documentation is also a goal
- graphQL, typescript, sequelize, express, yarn (ew, pnpm), 


## Commitments
- EVERYONE PLAY WITH MOBILE APP
    - ebuka to get it out
    - EVERYONE USE IT FOR WHAT YOU DO AND DON’T LIKE


- Website: Use the version that is up
    - James is getting the first version up right now
    - Melvin and Jaer willing to get into the website execution
    - What about design?

## Questions
What are short/mid/long-term goals?
- More focused on the products (but how they tie into the business goals)

What is generating revenue?
- Not self-banking
    - This is mainly for the merchants to receive crypto
- We have 2 ends of the spectrum and trying to bring it together
    - Our merchants are paying us money - so we are demonstrating value here
    - We have to build from an operational source of revenue to the self-banking
    - We need some ways for people to realize the value of self-banking

How do the products we have no fit into self-banking?
- Backpack is theoretically used by merchants (because it’s not up correctly, they can’t use it)
    - They are currently using TrustWallet - not a good outcome for people not using crypto
    - Backpack is an EOA wallet without any quality of life functions in it
        - So implement 4337 type account abstraction builds
        - But there are a bunch of spec related to this
- Pylon facilitates ALL of the onramp events (which we use per tx)
    - relates to existing and NEW customers
    - Continuing to add customers (not stuffing, but generating revenue to cover all costs)
- Missing a handful of dashboard for customers (and US!)
    - James has a lot of blueprint and the domains are well-modelled in spreadsheets
    - Card-issuance dashboard (rain APIs), cards are offramp events with customers
        - If you don’t have an ability to offramp (card, ACH, wire), then you start to feel trapped

They still have to get thru Rain compliance
- This is dependent on website to submit to compliance

**ACTION: Devin to make KPIs for next week?**
- They are doing something like 250K in tx volume/month
    - Trying to hit 500K tx volume
    - Year-end goal is to get to 10M in tx volume
